#+startup: overview

- posix threads
- single process can contain multiple threads,
  - executing the same program
  - sharing the same global memory (data and heap segments)
  - each thread has its own stack

* return value of most pthread_functions is 0 on success and error number on failure
  - same meanings as error numbers returned in errno
  - pthread_functions do not set errno

* Thread IDs

- type =pthread_t=
- returned to caller of [[id:c1ef2ad0-b452-403b-b8ec-f94caec3f4a4][pthread_create]]
- thread can obtain its own thread identifier using [[id:ce60c011-45bd-4d89-9f87-258d347bac46][pthread_self]]
- unique only within a process
- may be reused after [[id:929817b2-9b9d-4d92-b67c-6087216c2c53][pthread_join]] or [[id:dde21c90-ffe8-4644-8d4a-40eed4af9503][pthread_detach]]

* further process-wide attributes (see man)
  - process ID
  - parent process ID
  - process group ID and session ID
  - controlling terminal
  - user and group IDs
  - open file descriptors
  - record locks
  - signal dispositions
  - file mode creation mask
  - current directory and root directory
  - interval timers nad POSIX timers
  - nice value (man setpriority)
  - resource limits
  - measurements of the consumption of CPU time
